        <h1>Dear 順仁 - JJ,</h1>
        <p>
            I hope you are doing okay and not too exhausted thinking about many things.
            <br/>
            I understand that my action and words triggered something in you and you need time to organise your thoughts/feelings.
            I respect that and give you as much time as you need to do that. However, in the meantime, I wanted to let you know few things.
            So, I decided to write this e-letter (I thought it is a good idea to apply and share with you what I have been learning recently).
            <br/>
            To be honest, I am not sure what is the best I can do for you now. Would it be better if I just wait until you feel like to talk to me again? Or, are you actually expecting me to make some actions?
            I am not sure what has been triggered and what is bothering you.
            I have been thinking what has changed since last time we were talking with smiles. I honestly don't know what is bothering you and what I can do to solve that.
            <br/>
            If possible, after some thoughts on your own, I want you to talk to me. I want to understand what is making you worried or insecured.
            But I decided to give you time so I am trying my best to live the life as usual, not overthink too much because me thinking too much and being emotionally unstable will not help this situation any better.
            But I want you to know that even though I am trying to live my own life and daily routine here, you are still big part of my life, whatever I do, you are always in my head and heart.
            And that I believe you will eventually talk to me. I hope you didn't mean I am your partner only when things are going well.
            <br/>
            JJ, if what has been triggered is something significant, I hope you will talk to me not too late. Because I believe that we are building this relationship together, as well as trying to be the best friends to each other.
            Best frineds are supposed to be there to hear out, find solutions together when things get difficult.
            I am here not only when we are feeling happy. And if you are not happy or having doubts because of me or what I have done/said, then I would like to understand and make it right.
            <br/>
            Please do not forget that if you are thinking too much something about us, most likely it is the same on my side.
            I am having trouble understanding what is actually happening between us now.
            If I did something wrong, I want you to tell me because I would never do things to hurt you intentionally.
            <br/>
            As we just started to get to know each other, I think even slight difference in ways of thinking/accepting/perceiving things (Surechigai) can sometimes make us insecured.
            Because we are still learning about each other. Because we are still building trust between us.
            I think organising thoughts is absolutely important but in this kind of situation, talking to each other about how you feel, what made you feel that way, and vice versa is also important.
            <br/>
            Pushing you is the last thing I want to do. So, like I said, I will give you as much time as you need. But I hope you will talk to me like you would talk to your best friend.
            I want to apologise if I ever did anything wrong and I want to find the solution how to solve it if there is any misunderstanding or anything you do not feel comfortable about my behaviour.
            <br/>
            I hope you have a good rest.
